The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\r\n\t * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\r\n\t * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\r\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\r\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods.

This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports\r\n// mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.\r\n// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around\r\n// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.\r\n\r\n// `setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than\r\n// approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not\r\n// even then.\r\n\r\nfunction makeRequestCallFromTimer(callback) {\r\n    return function requestCall() {\r\n        // We dispatch a timeout with a specified delay of 0 for engines that\r\n        // can reliably accommodate that request. This will usually be snapped\r\n        // to a 4 milisecond delay, but once we're flushing, there's no delay\r\n        // between events.\r\n        var timeoutHandle = setTimeout(handleTimer, 0);\r\n        // However, since this timer gets frequently dropped in Firefox\r\n        // workers, we enlist an interval handle that will try to fire\r\n        // an event 20 times per second until it succeeds.\r\n        var intervalHandle = setInterval(handleTimer, 50);\r\n\r\n        function handleTimer() {\r\n            // Whichever timer succeeds will cancel both timers and\r\n            // execute the callback.\r\n            clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);\r\n            clearInterval(intervalHandle);\r\n            callback();\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This is for `asap.js` only.\r\n// Its name will be periodically randomized to break any code that depends on\r\n// its existence.\r\nrawAsap.makeRequestCallFromTimer = makeRequestCallFromTimer;\r\n\r\n// ASAP was originally a nextTick shim included in Q.

These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and\r\n// to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated\r\n// back into ASAP proper.\r\n//
